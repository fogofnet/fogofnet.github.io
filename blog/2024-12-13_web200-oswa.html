										<h2>My WEB-200 and OSWA experiences</h2>

									<p><b>2024-12-13</b></p>
									<p>In this blog post I would like to share with you my honest experiences from the <b>Foundational Web Application Assessments with Kali Linux course (WEB-200)</b> and the <b>OffSec Web Assessor (OSWA) Exam</b> from Offensive Security (OffSec).</p>

								<h2>My previous knowledge</h2>
								<p>I think it's important that you understand where I was before I started the WEB-200 course from Offensive Security.<br />
									Basically, I had basic knowledge of HTML, JS, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Python, etc. I could read scripts and do simple editing.
									But I can't write scripts from scratch and have to look up a lot on the Internet.
									I also had a basic understanding of DNS, HTTP/S, SMTP, TCP/IP, etc. But here too, only basic basics!<br /><br />
									I had no previous knowledge of cyber security.<br /><br />
									I am not a developer and I do not work in the IT sector. I am purely privately interested in the topics mentioned above and, most recently, cyber security.</p>
								
								<h2>Why I took the WEB-200</h2>
								<p>I wanted to find an introduction to the subject areas of bug bounty and web application assessments as well as penetration testing.
									It was important to me that I took a well-structured course that built on content. I wanted to find a quick and in-depth introduction without having to work out for myself which topics were relevant and then put them together myself from an infinite number of different resources. I wouldn't even know which resources were good and which were rather bad. That's why I chose Offensive Security and the WEB-200 course. It was also important to me that the course ended with a certificate that was recognized and required in the industry.</p>
								<p>I don't want to go into the content of the course in depth here. You can find all the important details about the course and the content at <a href="https://www.offsec.com/courses/web-200/" target="_blank">https://www.offsec.com/courses/web-200/</a>.</a></p>

								<h2>Which plan did I book?</h2>
								<p>I chose the Course and Certification Exam Bundle (90 days) because I wanted to set myself a fixed and manageable time frame. After extensive research into which topics would be covered in the course and what would be covered in these topics, I was of the opinion that I could learn this in three months and pass the exam.</p>
								
								<h2>How I structured the WEB-200 course over three months</h2>
								<p>First, I studied all the information that OffSec provides and in this case I don't mean the course itself.
									But all the additional information that you can find under <a href="https://help.offsec.com/hc/en-us/sections/6971423729044-Web-Attacks-with-Kali-Linux-WEB-200">Course Specific Resources for Offsec Students</a>.				
									I followed the <a href="https://help.offsec.com/hc/en-us/articles/15701019987732-OffSec-WEB-200-Learning-Plan-12-Week">Offsec WEB-200 Learning Plan - 12 Week</a>. At the same time, I worked through the OSA-WEB-200 videos for the corresponding week.
									This has enabled me to structure my study time accordingly and to give myself time to study every day, yes, every day.
									The secret, if there is one, is discipline. But more on that later.</p>

									<p>Since I have very little free time both professionally and privately, I really had to structure my daily routine down to the smallest detail in order to identify any free time that I could use for studying. I repeated this process every few weeks and always found further ways to optimize it.
										To get an idea of ​​how I studied, here are a few brief insights:<br />
										I studied every morning from 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.
										During my commute, I watched the WEB-200 and OSA-WEB-200 videos or read through my notes.
										When I had to wait for a long time, I opened my laptop and worked on the labs or learning content, no matter where I was (subway, doctor, during the lunch break etc.)
										This was the only way I was able to finish the course in three months and then attempt the exam.<br />
										My time planning worked out very well. But it was also very exhausting and intense. I had about 4-5 hours of sleep every night. Sometimes only 3-4 hours.</p>
								
								<h2>Why taking notes is the most important thing of all</h2>
								<p>I can only speak for myself, for me personally it was important from the beginning to have a very good note-taking strategy. I had to learn that first, but after a very short time I found my system for note-taking. I use <a href="https://joplinapp.org/ ">Joplin</a> on all my devices and synchronize it encrypted via webdav. Perfect, at least for me. That way I have all my notes on all my devices synchronized and ready to hand at all times and can study or look something up anywhere. Or just write notes. It was precisely this structured approach that got me to my goal very quickly in the exam. I had notes for basically everything I had learned in the WEB-200 course and what I had researched myself or found online. Firstly, the explanation that is necessary to be able to understand it quickly even after a long time, and secondly, copy and paste commands that I can insert directly. This gave me what I felt was a structured way of working during the exam, while at the same time speeding it up.</p>
